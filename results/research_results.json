          "description": "**Background & Motivation**\nCurrent lithium\u2011iron\u2011phosphate (LFP) energy\u2011storage systems rely on passive thermal\u2011management hardware that activates only after a temperature rise, leaving the early chemical degradation phase unchecked. Existing phase\u2011change material (PCM) buffers are static and cannot be timed to the exact moment when exothermic reactions begin. Recent studies have shown that distinct acoustic emissions accompany SEI breakdown, electrolyte decomposition, and lithium plating, offering a real\u2011time window for intervention.\n\n**Objective**\nTo create a *smart\u2011battery* architecture that (i) continuously monitors high\u2011frequency acoustic signatures inside an LFP cell, (ii) classifies early\u2011runaway events with >\u202f95\u202f% sensitivity, and (iii) autonomously releases a precisely engineered endothermic PCM via focused ultrasound, thereby absorbing the runaway heat before the temperature exceeds critical limits.\n\n**Innovation**\nThe proposal uniquely integrates (a) a MEMS\u2011based broadband acoustic sensor/actuator directly fabricated on the cell tab, (b) a silica\u2011polymer hybrid microcapsule that ruptures at a calibrated acoustic pressure, and (c) a data\u2011driven detection algorithm trained on a newly generated, publicly released acoustic\u2011emission dataset. This closed\u2011loop sensing\u2011actuation system has not been demonstrated for battery safety, representing a paradigm shift from reactive cooling to proactive mitigation.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n- Demonstrated ultrasonic rupture of PCM capsules inside a sealed cell without damaging electrodes.\n- Quantified thermal mitigation: \u2265\u202f150\u202fkJ of latent heat released per event, limiting temperature rise to <\u202f10\u202f\u00b0C.\n- Detection performance meeting the defined FP/FN targets, validated on full\u2011scale modules.\n- A validated design package (materials, transducer layout, control firmware) ready for technology transfer to battery manufacturers.\n\n**Impact**\nBy eliminating the need for bulky external cooling systems and providing an autonomous safety layer, the technology can reduce pack weight by ~5\u202f%, lower system cost, and enable higher energy densities for electric\u2011vehicle and grid\u2011scale LFP applications. The open\u2011source LAR dataset and the MEMS\u2011fabrication guidelines will also catalyze further research in acoustic\u2011based battery health monitoring.",

          "description": "Thermal runaway in lithium\u2011iron\u2011phosphate (LFP) energy\u2011storage systems often originates from subtle, system\u2011level interactions that are invisible to traditional BMS thresholds based on single\u2011cell voltage or temperature.

By training on a curated blend of public (NASA Ames, CALCE) and proprietary high\u2011frequency LFP\u2011ESS data, and by following a rigorously defined train/validation/test split, we will quantify how early the system can flag an incipient runaway (target: 30\u201360\u202fmin lead\u2011time) while maintaining >\u202f99\u202f% specificity. A three\u2011phase hardware plan moves from full classical simulation to a real quantum processor and finally to a hybrid edge deployment that respects the sub\u201150\u202fms latency budget of automotive BMS. Comprehensive baselines (LSTM, GNN, PINN) will be evaluated on identical metrics, ensuring that any reported advantage is attributable to the quantum\u2011inspired representation rather than data\u2011selection bias. The outcome will be a reproducible, open\u2011source toolbox that demonstrates, for the first time, how quantum\u2011inspired kernels can materially improve early\u2011warning safety in large\u2011scale LFP battery packs.",
