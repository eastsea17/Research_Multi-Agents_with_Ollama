2. Cross-pollination: Fuse methodologies from disparate and unrelated fields to create novel solutions.
3. Specific Methodology: You must include concrete technical methodologies (e.g., specific algorithms, architectures, or experimental designs).
4. High Risk, High Return: Prioritize ambitious topics that promise significant rewards and revolutionary impact, even if they carry a possibility of failure.
5. Avoid coming up with research topics that are too unrealistic and long-winded.
